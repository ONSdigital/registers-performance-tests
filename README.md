# About this project
This project is a repository of Gatling based performance tests targeted at individual endpoints in sbr-control-api.

# Pre-requisites

## Setup target project(s) locally
It is assumed that you have setup the target project locally. See below for links to project supported.

### Setup sbr-control-api
It is assumed that you have followed the guide to setup sbr-control-api (See sbr-control-api's [Development Setup (MacOS)](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sbr-control-api#development-setup-macos) )

### Setup address-index-api, address-index-demo-ui, address-index-data
Head over to the [following](https://collaborate2.ons.gov.uk/confluence/display/RAI/Setting+up+Address+Index+Server+and+UI+with+local+ElasticSearch) page on Confluence.

## Setup Gatling
As a part of setting up [sbr-control-api](#setup-sbr-control-api) or [address-index-api](#setup-address-index-api-address-index-demo-ui-address-index-data), you will have all the pre-requisites in place to run the gatling simulations in this project.

Setup involves:

1. Downloading the zip bundle from [gatling.io](https://gatling.io/download/) and,
2. Setting the `GATLING_HOME` environment variable depending on where the above bundle has been unzipped.

## OS Tuning
In order to subject any kind of meaningful load, OS tuning must be done in order to raise or un-restrict resource consumption limits imposed by consumer oriented OSes.

On macOS, the constraints most relevant to Gatling load tests include:

1. The maximum number of open files (`sysctl kern.maxfiles` )
2. The maximum number of open files per process (`sysctl kern.maxfilesperproc` )
3. The maximum number of open processes
4. The maximum number of open ports ('ephemeral port limit')
5. The maximum time before a TCP socket can be re-used

Instructions on altering all of the above limits is detailed in [macOS Tuning for Gatling](macOS%20Tuning%20for%20Gatling.md)


# Usage

The gatling simulations are executed using the official gatling SBT plugin. Sample usages:

To simply run *all* the simulation(s):
`sbt gatling:test`

To run a specific simulation:
`sbt "gatling:testOnly uk.gov.ons.gatling.simulations.RegistersSimulation"`
`sbt "gatling:testOnly uk.gov.ons.gatling.simulations.SomeOtherSimulation"`

To pass in a configurable property to the simulation(s):
`JAVA_OPTS="-DconcurrentUsers=10000" sbt gatling:test`

A useful example is as follows, where the number of users is passed in, a specific config file is used and at the end of the simulation the reports is automatically opened:
JAVA_OPTS="-DconcurrentUsers=100 -DconfigFileName=ai-api-pcs-exeter.conf" sbt clean compile "gatling:testOnly uk.gov.ons.gatling.simulations.RegistersSimulation" "gatling:lastReport"

(The above runs the gatling simulation using the request as in ai-api-pcs.exeter.conf file and assumes that the AI server is running locally, for example, like so:

```shell
JAVA_OPTS="-Xms2g -Xmx2g -DONS_AI_API_ES_PORT=9200 -DONS_AI_API_ES_URI=localhost -DONS_AI_API_HYBRID_INDEX_HIST=hybrid-historical_811_111017_1530276985432" \
sbt "project address-index-server" "run 9001"
```

The above runs the AI server and configures it to use ElasticSearch running at `localhost:9200` with index name specified by   ONS_AI_API_HYBRID_INDEX_HIST property.
)
